PDE Project 

To compile and run the project : 
g++ Project\*.cpp -o project.exe
         .\project.exe  
To generate the graph: 
python plot_convergence.py

The matrix invertibility test is implemented at the end of Matrix.cpp and is 
executed when running the project.

The numerical results are in Convergence_results.csv.
The convergence plot is generated in Convergence.png using the Python script.
